**Jelenoid** is a high-performance, lightweight, and fully customizable Selenium hub written in Java/Spring. It provides native support for both **Selenium** and **Playwright**, allowing you to run UI tests in isolated Docker containers through a single API.

Unlike simple proxies, Jelenoid acts as a full-fledged orchestrator, dynamically managing the lifecycle of browser seleniumSessions to ensure a clean and reliable environment for every test run.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

### üåê General Functionality
- **Dynamic Container Management:** Automatically starts and stops Docker containers for each seleniumSession.
- **Full Test Isolation:** Provides a clean environment for every test run.
- **Resource Limiting:** Sets limits on the number of parallel seleniumSessions and browser versions.
- **Request Queue:** Features an integrated queuing mechanism to manage load, which is critical for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Jelenoid UI:** A simple and convenient web interface for monitoring seleniumSessions.


### ü§ñ Selenium
- **Full W3C WebDriver Proxying:** Reliably forwards all commands of the protocol.
- **Centralized State Management:** A single service (`ActiveSessionsService`) tracks all active seleniumSessions.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Full support for `alwaysMatch` / `firstMatch` and vendor-specific options (`selenoid:options`).
- **File Uploads:** Easily upload files to the container during a test via the `/seleniumSession/{sessionId}/file` endpoint.
- **Live VNC Streaming:** Interactive, real-time access to the browser's desktop via any noVNC client.
- **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) Proxy:** Direct access to the browser's DevTools for network emulation and other debugging tasks.

### üé≠ Playwright
- **Native Support:** Full integration for running Playwright tests.
- **Command Proxying:** Reliably forwards commands from the test to the browser.
- **Session Management:** Dynamically creates and manages seleniumSessions in containers.
